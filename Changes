Revision history for Perl extension Win32API::File.

0.08 Fri Apr  7 22:36:06 2000
	- C<GetOsFHandle> now returns false for failure.
	- New F<buffers.h> supports C++ compilers.
	- Read-only output-only parameters now generate an error.
	- Added fileLastError() since C<$^E> is often quickly overwritten.
	- Complete rewrite of how C constants are made available in Perl.
	- Added fileConstant(), a nice way to look-up constants at run time.
	- Added Get/SetHandleInformation and HANDLE_FLAG_* constants.
	- Added IOCTL_DISK_GET_MEDIA_TYPES since *_STORAGE_* fails for floppy.
	- Added several example scripts.

0.07  Tue Aug 17 13:04:54 1999
	- Added DeleteFile().
	- Removed prototypes from OsFHandleOpen() and GetOsFHandle() since
	  the C<*> doesn't prevent warnings about bareword file handles and
	  prevents the useful usage message if no arguments given.
	- Fixed bug due to failed C<(/k/i,/t/i)> in list context returning
	  C<()> not C<(undef,undef)> in modern versions of Perl.
	- Change order of C<#include>s so can build with Perl5.005 and later.
	- Fixed C<test.pl> to ignore Perl bug where C<$^E> is truncated.
	- Turned on C<CAPI> in C<Makefile.PL> for certain versions of Perl.
	- Updated C<README>.

0.06  Tue Aug 10 20:50:21 1999
	- Switch to new buffers.h and "Hungarian" notation!
	- Added full documentation!
	- ReadFile() no longer tries to read more bytes than asked for
	  just because the scalar buffer can hold more bytes!
	- createFile() does better DWIM for share mode.
	- Return SV_NO rather than C<0> for Boolean false.
	- For boolean args, non-empty strings are C<1>, don't convert to int.
	- Added ":MEDIA_TYPE" export class.
	- Added C<GENERIC_ALL> and C<GENERIC_EXECUTE> to ":GENERIC_" exports.
	- Added C<FdGetOsFHandle()> and C<GetOsFHandle()>!
	- Added C<OsFHandleOpenFd()> and C<OsFHandleOpen()>!
	- Support calling C<constant()> without the useless integer argument.
	- Auto-load/export constants with C<()> prototype so can be in-lined.
	- Added C<IsRecognizedPartition()> and C<IsContainerPartition()>.
	- Added C<getLogicalDrives()>.
	- Added ":FILE_" export class for specific types of access to files.
	- Added C<SECURITY_SQOS_PRESENT> to ":SECURITY_" export class.
	- Added ":PARTITION_" export class for partition types.
	- Seriously bulked up the test suite.

0.05  Fri Aug 21 11:01:49 1998
	- "-w" no longer warns that a buffer size of "=99" "isn't numeric".
	  nor if pass undef var for buffer size or output-only parameter.
	- Added SetErrorMode() and :SEM_.
	- createFile() sharing now defaults to "rw" to match C RTL.
	- createFile() was ignoring "r" and "w" in access masks.

0.04  Thu Aug 13 17:05:16 1998
	- Added GetLogicalDrives and GetLogicalDriveStrings.
	- Added GetDriveType and GetVolumeInformation.
	- Added DRIVE_* for GetDriveType().
	- Added FS_* for GetVolumeInformation().
	- Added createFile(), getLogicalDrives(), and attrLetsToBits() helpers.
	- CreateFile() returns:  INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE->false, 0->"0 but true".
	- More standardized "Hungarian" notation and uses buffers.h.
	- Large unsigned values no longer made negative.

0.03  Sat Apr 25 19:58:19 1998
	- Added DDD_* constants to File.pm and moved codes mistakenly
	  exported for :DDD_ to be exported for :Misc.
	- Split large group of constants to increase efficiency.
	- Minor cosmetic fixes.

0.02  Tue Mar 03 12:37:09 1998
	- Added DeviceIoControl().
	- Added some IOCTL_STORAGE_* and IOCTL_DISK_* constants
	- Taught test.pl to verify all exported functions and constants.

0.01  Mon Dec 08 12:54:10 1997
	- original version; based on Win32API::Registry.
